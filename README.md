# Rotten Tomatoes on Netflix
Sick of switching between Rotten Tomatoes and Netflix to look up movies? Display Rotten Tomatoes scores directly on Netflix!

## About
* This is a Tampermonkey userscript. You need to install the Tampermonkey browser extension and then copy this script into it.
* This script only works for movies, not TV shows.
* The score is shown in the details section of each movie along with the rotten/fresh tomato icon. If you click on either, it will open the
Rotten Tomatoes page in a new tab.
* Movies are matched by title and by year. Sometimes the name of the movie won't exactly match between Rotten Tomatoes and Netflix, 
so the score will not appear :(
